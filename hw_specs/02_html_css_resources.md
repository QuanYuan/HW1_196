1. Put a link to your blog or twitter timeline (or other interesting site) on your app's index.html page
2. Put a form that contains fields that make sense for the app you're planning to build. For example if you're building a blog make a form for a post with a title and body. This doesn't have to store data for now.
3. Style your new index.html by hand or using a CSS framework
4. Push the resulting app to heroku and github, submit both links for review.

Bonus (3 points): Make a resource for your rails application. User Chrome, telnet or curl to interact with it (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Submit a text file HAR or copy of all the commands and output. Note that this resource does not need to be deployed to Heroku, a local test is fine.
